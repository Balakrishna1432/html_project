<h1 align="center">ABOUT WHEY PROTEIN</h1>
<hr>
<p>Whey protein isolate (WPI) is a type of protein derived from milk, specifically from the liquid whey that remains after cheese-making. Let’s delve into the details:

<h1>Composition:</h1>
Whey: Whey is a group of eight proteins found in cow’s milk. These proteins include beta-lactoglobulin, alpha-lactalbumin, glycomacropeptide, immunoglobulins, bovine serum albumin, lactoferrin, lactoperoxidase, and lysozyme.
Whey Isolate: To create whey protein isolate, manufacturers process whey further to reduce its fat and lactose content, leaving mainly protein. This makes it a purer form of protein compared to regular whey protein concentrate.
<h1>Processing:</h1>
<h1>Whey Concentrate:</h1> Whey protein concentrate is used in various products like protein shakes, bars, and infant formula. It contains varying amounts of lactose and fat.
<h1>Whey Isolate:</h1> Whey isolate undergoes additional purification steps, resulting in very low fat and lactose content. It’s suitable for individuals with lactose intolerance but not for those with milk allergies.
<h1>Hydrolysate:</h1> Hydrolyzed whey protein has broken-down protein chains, making it easier to digest. It’s commonly used in infant formulas.
<h1>Benefits:</h1>
<h1>Muscle Building:</h1> Both whey protein and whey isolate aid in building strong muscles due to their amino acid content.
<h1>Healing Properties:</h1> Whey protein may help skin heal faster after injuries or surgery.
<h1>Weight Gain:</h1> Whey protein contributes to muscle growth, leading to weight gain.
<h1>Nutritional Supplement:</h1> If your diet lacks sufficient protein, whey products can fill the gap.
<h1>Pros:</h1>
<h1>Amino Acids:</h1> Whey protein provides essential amino acids that aid in muscle building and immune cell production.
<h1>Consistent Protein Intake:</h1> Since our bodies can process only 20-40 grams of protein at a time, whey supplements ensure consistent protein intake throughout the day.</p>
